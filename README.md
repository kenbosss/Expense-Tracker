in real time. The application provides a clear and concise overview of your financial status, with a focus on ease of use and functionality.


Features

Total Balance: Displays the overall balance calculated from your income and expenses. This gives you a quick snapshot of your financial health.
Income and Expense Containers:
Income: All transactions that are marked as income are displayed in green. These values contribute positively to your total balance.
Expenses: All transactions that are marked as expenses are displayed in red. These values are subtracted from your total balance.
Real-time Calculations: As you input new transactions, the application automatically updates the total balance, income, and expenses. This ensures that your financial data is always up to date.
History Log: Each transaction is stored in the history section, allowing you to review past entries and keep track of your financial decisions.
How It Works

Input Your Transactions: To add a new transaction, simply enter a description and the amount in the input fields. Positive amounts will be treated as income, while negative amounts will be treated as expenses.
Automatic Sorting: Transactions are automatically sorted, with income appearing at the top and expenses at the bottom, making it easy to distinguish between the two.
Instant Updates: Upon adding a transaction, the total balance, income, and expenses are instantly recalculated and displayed in their respective containers.
Technologies Used

Front-End: The application is built entirely in React.
State Management: Global state is managed using React's Context API, allowing for efficient and scalable data handling across the application.
